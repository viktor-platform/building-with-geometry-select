This app shows how a simple building can be parametrically defined and elements can be added by clicking on the geometry.

1. The general dimensions of the building can be defined, which is directly shown in a 3D visualization.
2. Columns and floors can be added by clicking on the building.
3. Balconies can be added by clicking on the facade, where the width and color of the balcony can be defined parametrically.

The main goal of this app is to show the nice possibilities for interaction with the geometry view!
